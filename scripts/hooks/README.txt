ELMSLN Config - Scripts - hooks

This is where you can hook into some of the more complex parts of the ELMSLN setup routine.

The folder names match the file that you are able to modify / work against and then there are example hooks inside which fire at different points in that fileâ€™s operation. This can be used for more advanced deployment customizations, such as fractal networks or provisioning between servers.
