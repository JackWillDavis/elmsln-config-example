CIS IMPLEMENTATION EXAMPLE
==========================

These examples are very implementation specific. They’d be common things you’d build (or have built automatically) like the connection registry keychain, or what data-source to use for roster synchronization (when not using LTI or using a backup).  There’s also some ultra specific kinds of modifications to ELMSLN from its original build at PSU. These serve to illustrate some more common Drupal modifications you can jump in via hooks and things to bend it to your needs.
